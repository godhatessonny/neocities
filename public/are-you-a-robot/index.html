          <p>"Are you a robot?" was a group project from my first year at university. We were tasked with creating a chatbot using the programming language Rivescript.</p>
          <p>It didn't have the best outcome as this was pretty much our first time programming but for the start of a chatbot that is designed with no AI and had to have each potential reply programmed.</p>
          <p>We based ours off of HAL 9000 from "2001: A Space Odyssey". Type hello/hi/hey to give it a go.</p>

            THREE YEAR OLD BUGS I HAVEN'T FIXED: <br>
            â—˜ When asking for your name, if you type your name without "my name is", it gives an error.<br>
            â—˜ Nowadays you would talk to an chatbot however you like but with how limited of a dialog tree this has, you can't say much unique without it giving an error.<br>
            â—˜ Dialogue is inaccurate to  how a terminal would output things and "l33t 5p34k"(leet speak) is inaccessible and cringy
